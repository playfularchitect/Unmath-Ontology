## WHY I AM RIGHT. 
I want to address something...The burden of proof. 
I want to ask you all something....What else comes close? I have provided:

A mechanism for something from nothing
A pathway from matter to consciousness
Empirical demonstration that it works
Philosophical coherence
Computational reproducibility

I have built a reality engine based on a unified theory that connects consciousness, physics, mathematics, and existence itself.
The real question is not whether my simulation proves this is how reality works...it is whether anyone can provide a better explanation that is anywhere near as complete and mechanistic!
